# Sign to Me

"SignToMe" is a Windows app that sends reminders for Adzan (Islamic call to prayer). It allows users to schedule Adzan sessions and set reminders for regular practice. It also includes a feature for recording and tracking progress over time. It's perfect for Muslims who want to stay on top of their religious practices.

## Getting Started
To get started, the first thing you need to do is set your location in the settings page. This is important because prayer times are based on your location. Once you have set your location, you can adjust other settings such as time format, language, and notification sounds (adhan or without adhan) on the settings page.
On the main page, you can see the current time and date, as well as the next prayer time. The schedule page shows the prayer schedule for today.
Note: This is only available for registered regions in Indonesia, and there may still be some bugs.
